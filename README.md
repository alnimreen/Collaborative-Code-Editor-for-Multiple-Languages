# Atypon's Training Capstone Project

This project describes the building of a Collaborative Code Editor, a web-based platform that enables several users to edit and run code together in real time. The platform is built with Java on the back end and React JavaScript on the front end, and it supports real-time communication via WebSocket, allowing for immediate changes among clients. The server component handles user authentication using OAuth 2.0, role-based access control, and complex file management with version control, allowing users to return to previous code states. The system allows code execution in separate Docker containers, allowing for multi-language compatibility across a variety of development environments. Key challenges addressed in including concurrency management, thread safety, secure communication (SSL), and the integration of DevOps practices like CI/CD pipelines for automatic deployment using tools like GitHub Actions. This project demonstrates the application of clean code principles, scalability, and software engineering best practices, offering a powerful solution for collaborative coding environments.
